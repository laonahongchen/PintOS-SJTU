# Pintos
This is a course work of Operating system@SJTU. [Pintos](http://pintos-os.org) is a teaching operating system for x86, challenging but not overwhelming, small
but realistic enough to understand OS in depth (it can run x86 machine and simulators 
including QEMU and Bochs). 

The course TA([Yunfeng Lin])@creeperlin made some changes to the original Pintos labs to tailor for our class. 

We implemented the first three part of the project, i.e, threads, userprog, and VM. Filesys is also coded but still have a little bug.

The design doc is in the doc directory.
